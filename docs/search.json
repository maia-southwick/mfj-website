    "text": "Mission Statement\nCurrent expectations are to first, build a small UCD community of graduate students who are interested in moral reasoning, fairness, justice, and other related concepts in their research. This would begin with an initial exchange of ideas (e.g., a reading group) and snowball into other activities such as community engagement, presentation of research, and collaboration. The more people the better, and so we want to set-up this reading group for long-term success in a sustainable way. Eventual governance positions will be set into place."
